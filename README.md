## Mini - GitHub
<p>I have created a (mini) Github, Here users can see some random GitHub users' data short on the home page. if the user wants to see more details about the user simply click on “more details”, where the user can able to view basic details Like repo Id, User Name, description, and many more. Also able to view All Repositories where clicking on “view GitHub” will redirect to the GitHub page of that particular repositories.</p>
